## About

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with more than 8 years of experience currently specializing in Android development. My Journey in Software Engineering began in 2013 where I was supporting a trading system as a Java developer. Since then, I've got some experience working with Kotlin and Python backends, created Telegram bots, handled servers and CI/CD for a million MAU prooject on GCP platform, developed about 10 Android Apps for product companies. Obtained my MSc in Software Engineering through <a href="https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/program-history/msit-se/index.html">the Carnegie-Mellon University program</a> in 2016.

Apart from my job I organize meetups and lectures about development. Often speak about various topics. I am currently participating in Android Academy Global where we give free lessons on Android Development that can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkVThwbjthEg2RR4iuDQWA">in Youtube</a>.
